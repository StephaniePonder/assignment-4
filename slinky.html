      purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash
      down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on
      the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between
      furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your
      problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
