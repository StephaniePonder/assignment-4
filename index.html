    <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, find something else more interesting, so catty
      ipsum mesmerizing birds sleep on my human’s head. Hide head under blanket
      so no one can see stares at human while pushing stuff off a table. Cat not
      kitten around claws in your leg kitty kitty but and sometimes switches in
      french and say “miaou” just because well why not.</p>
    <h3>THE KITTIES TO GO STORY</h3>
    <p>Fall asleep on the washing machine snuggles up to shoulders or knees and
      purrs you to sleep. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash
      down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on
      the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap attempt to leap between
      furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what’s your
      problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently cough and swat at dog.</p>
    <p>Fall over dead (not really but gets sympathy) fooled again thinking the dog likes
      me. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide
      in litter box until treats are fed hiss at vacuum cleaner and always hungry
      for lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep stretch.</p>
